# MazeRunner
My team, comprising of Richard Irwin, Dillon Brown, and myself, built a playable maze using an FPGA and VGA controller.

Mazerun is a game that lets the player control a square as it makes its way through a maze. The player is not allowed to toauch the walls, or the game flashes a "Game Over" screen. The objective is reaching a blue square within the maze. When this is reached, the screen flashes a screen that reads "WIN!" against a green background.
